  "faq.a1": "A QR code is a two-dimensional barcode that can be read by smartphone cameras and QR scanner apps. It stores information in a square pattern, which can represent text, a website link, contact details, and more. QR codes are popular because they are fast to scan and can hold more information than classic barcodes.",
  "faq.a10a": "A static QR code stores the final information directly in the code and cannot be changed after creation. It is free, simple, and reliable long term. A dynamic QR code uses a redirect, allowing the destination to be updated later and often providing scan analytics, but it depends on a third-party service. For more details, see the",
  "faq.a10b": "page.",
  "faq.a11": "No. This website generates QR codes entirely in your browser. The data you enter is not stored, uploaded, or processed on a server. QR codes are generated client-side only, which means your information stays on your device.",
  "faq.a12": "No personal data is sold or shared with third parties. This website does not collect personal information from QR code content. If analytics are enabled, they are used only to understand general site usage and improve the service, not to identify individuals.",
  "faq.a2": "A QR code stores data as a grid of dark and light squares. When you scan it, the camera reads the pattern and converts it back into data, such as a URL or a contact card. QR codes also include error correction, which helps scanners recover the data even if the code is slightly dirty or partially covered.",
  "faq.a3": "Capacity depends on the QR version and the type of content. As a rough guide, QR codes can store thousands of characters. Numeric content can store more than text. In practice, shorter payloads scan faster and more reliably, so it is usually best to keep the encoded content concise.",
  "faq.a4": "Many industries are moving toward 2D codes because they can hold more information and can be used both by checkout systems and by consumers. Standards like GS1 Digital Link also make it possible for one code to serve multiple purposes, such as product identification plus a link to extra details.",
  "faq.a5": "Not at all. QR codes continue to expand into new use cases, including payments, menus, access control, marketing, and quick information sharing. They are simple, widely supported, and still evolving with modern standards.",
  "faq.a6": "A safe minimum is about 3 cm by 3 cm, which is around 1 inch by 1 inch. If you are unsure, printing larger is usually better than printing smaller, especially if scanning happens from a distance.",
  "faq.a7": "Vector format such as SVG can scale to any size without becoming blurry. This is ideal for print because it stays sharp on everything from small labels to large posters.",
  "faq.a8": "Often yes. QR codes include error correction, which can recover data even when part of the pattern is missing. How much damage is recoverable depends on how much of the code is affected and how strong the error correction is. If you use QR codes for print, it helps to keep a clean quiet zone around the code and use strong contrast.",
  "faq.a9": "Yes, as long as there is enough contrast between the code and the background. Many scanners rely on strong contrast, so you should test across multiple phones and lighting conditions. For reliable scanning, dark code on a light background is still the safest choice.",
